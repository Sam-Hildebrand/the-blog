## Monday Devotional: Hypocrisy

Much of the Gospels are filled with Jesus speaking to and about pharisees. I don't know what percent of His time was actually spent dealing with pharisees,
but the Bible certainly records a lot of messages to, - and even more about - pharisees. Personally, I believe this is because the Bible is a religious Book,
and,  therefore, read by religious people. Religious people are highly susceptible to hypocrisy.

It is in the fallen nature of man to be hypocritical. When God call out to Adam in the garden, Adam replied, 
> "...I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself."(Gen. 3:10). 

What I believe Adam is saying here is essentially,
> 1. I sinned.
> 2. I realized my shame caused by my sin, but... 
> 3. Rather than admit my sin and face the consequences, I've covered it as well as I can.

 Adam saw the shame in sin. This characteristic shows he was a child of God. However he failed to realize that, even though the consequences
 would still be present, he could confess his sin and seek forgiveness.
